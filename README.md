## Project Statement

### User Input Requirements
Your system will need to handle information about courses, and display them in a weekly calendar view (similar to a schedule planner). 
The system should allow the user to input these parameters:
                    - Course Name (e.g Software Engineering)
                    - Course Code (e.g CS330)
                    - Section Number (e.g 01)
                    - Course Credit (e.g 3-credit)
                    - Frequency of Lectures (e.g 3 x a week)
                    - Instructor Name (e.g Dr. Feng)
                    - Preferred Timing (e.g M, W, F 9:00-10:00 AM)
                    - Preferred Classroom (e.g BHSN 224)
